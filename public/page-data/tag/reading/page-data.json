The number of licensed geriatrics doctors in the US fell by 25% from 1996-2010, even as the population aged. Generalists can provide elder care, of course, but at last one RCT showed that patients that see a geriatric specialist have better outcomes than those seeing a generalist.

By plotting the emotional arc of a story as a function of time, Vonnegut shows a couple generic paths that encompass a lot of stories -- such as 'man in hole' (a fall when something bad happens, then a rise when it gets resolved) or 'Cinderella' (a rise from the bottom, a fall when the clock strikes midnight, then a rise to happily ever after)."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/52-things-I-learned-2020","categorySlug":"/category/random/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"52 things I learned in 2020","date":"2020-12-27T12:00:00","category":"random","description":"1.

Picking up a book on time management gives me the thrill that the secret to happiness is right around the corner, when in fact the real problem is that I have 30 hours' worth of things I want to do each day, which won't be solved by any book."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/Can-you-judge-a-book-by-its-cover","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Can you judge a book by its cover?","date":"2020-11-29T12:00:00","category":"data-science","description":"You know the adage: you can't judge a book by its cover. But let's be real, I do it all the time, and you probably do too. You can think of books that confirm or disprove the old saying, but advancements in AI, image recognition algorithms, and crowdsourcing platforms allow us to go beyond anecdotes and analyze this in more detail: can you judge a book by its cover after all?"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"reading","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":6,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/reading","nextPagePath":"/tag/reading/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
