This series takes a broad view of strategy, reflecting the multifaceted imperatives that leaders face. It goes beyond the static view of classical strategy and explores the dynamic side of strategy that is necessary for a complex, uncertain context. And it goes beyond the traditional role of the strategy function to explore implications in other areas, such as technology, organizational design, and management and leadership broadly.

There are no easy answers, due to the unpredictability of disease dynamics, a lack of relevant prior experience, and the absence of plug-and-play instructions from government or international authorities. With China having experienced the outbreak several weeks ahead of other countries, we distill a dozen lessons from Chinese companies’ experience that the rest of the world can learn from.
