By plotting the emotional arc of a story as a function of time, Vonnegut shows a couple generic paths that encompass a lot of stories -- such as 'man in hole' (a fall when something bad happens, then a rise when it gets resolved) or 'Cinderella' (a rise from the bottom, a fall when the clock strikes midnight, then a rise to happily ever after)."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/52-things-I-learned-2020","categorySlug":"/category/random/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"52 things I learned in 2020","date":"2020-12-27T12:00:00","category":"random","description":"1. Commercial and consumer toilet paper have different specifications and separate supply chains, which led to the early-pandemic shortages. The same is true of a wide range of perhaps surprising products, such as bananas: restaurants and cafeterias order smaller, loose bananas, whereas supermarkets order larger bananas in bunches.

I consider it a guilty pleasure because I know they have basically the same advice -- there are only so many ways to say 'put down your phone,' 'protect time for focused work,' and 'avoid task-switching.' Picking up a book on time management gives me the thrill that the secret to happiness is right around the corner, when in fact the real problem is that I have 30 hours' worth of things I want to do each day, which won't be solved by any book."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/Can-you-judge-a-book-by-its-cover","categorySlug":"/category/data-science/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Can you judge a book by its cover?","date":"2020-11-29T12:00:00","category":"data-science","description":"You know the adage: you can't judge a book by its cover. But let's be real, I do it all the time, and you probably do too. You can think of books that confirm or disprove the old saying, but advancements in AI, image recognition algorithms, and crowdsourcing platforms allow us to go beyond anecdotes and analyze this in more detail: can you judge a book by its cover after all?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/hot-hand-fallacy-fallacy-fallacy","categorySlug":"/category/sports/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The hot hand fallacy fallacy fallacy","date":"2020-11-01T12:00:00","category":"sports","description":"You've probably heard of the hot hand fallacy. In many areas, but most famously in basketball, people have long believed in the hot hand: a player who made their last couple shots was more likely to make the next one as well. But a famous 1985 study, analyzing some in-game NBA data and some experiments with Cornell basketball players, found that there was no correlation between previous shots and the outcome of the next one -- there was no hot hand."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":6,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
