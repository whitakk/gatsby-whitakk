What I mean by opponent elasticity is how much worse an offense gets when they play a better defense.

The number of licensed geriatrics doctors in the US fell by 25% from 1996-2010, even as the population aged.

Picking up a book on time management gives me the thrill that the secret to happiness is right around the corner, when in fact the real problem is that I have 30 hours' worth of things I want to do each day, which won't be solved by any book."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":6,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
