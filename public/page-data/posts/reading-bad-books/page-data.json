I consider it a guilty pleasure because I know they have basically the same advice — there are only so many ways to say “put down your phone,” “protect time for focused work,” and “avoid task-switching.” Picking up a book on time management gives me the thrill that the secret to happiness is right around the corner, when in fact the real problem is that I have 30 hours’ worth of things I want to do each day, which won’t be solved by any book.</p>\n<p>Some of these books, objectively, are even quite bad. Early this year I read <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=SwiTY48lAR&#x26;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</a></em>, which is written in a really annoying tone, <a href=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5caaa2520cf57d48aa68f502/1574128726172-YMD8IRRWCLRPN0124MD0/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kG0_wXnvFVYtr8E_VwG1MC17gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0oycmklwMHPwSb2Cr-KYzbquWy9VPGv6wFvhrGUqx6g8NlifStCYa3WZ7XhuX6TLGw/Essentialism+Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">is full of weird drawings</a>, and has very little actual content — every other Goodreads review ends with the joke “this author should have done less and made this book half as long.”</p>\n<p>And yet, I keep reading them — and often taking something useful away from them. <em>Essentialism</em> helped me internalize that there really is a trade-off in what I do with my time, and that I can’t have it all. <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502354-rest?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=b8ICnsD8Zu&#x26;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rest</a></em> pointed me to a useful framework for <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/job.672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">what it takes to recover from the workweek</a>. *<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=t6p5TWJven&#x26;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Make Time</a> *introduced the idea of a “daily highlight” — if you pick one important thing to do today and actually do it, you should be happy with how you spent your time — which I find especially helpful on weekends.</p>\n<p>Why can reading bad books be good? It helps to think about the point of reading in the first place. (Again, mainly talking about non-fiction here.) Pure enjoyment is one factor; learning new information is another. But a third is that reading a book can inspire you to rethink things or come up with your own ideas. And this is especially relevant for the book format — reading a book isn’t a very *efficient *way to take in new information (how much will you really remember from a 300-page book a week later?), but the flip side of that is you have more time to think about what it means.</p>\n<p>“Bad” books fall short on the first two dimensions — they aren’t very enjoyable (unless it’s in a perverse way), and they don’t have new or compelling information. But they can still fulfill the third purpose. Yes, “good” writing often helps you think about things in a new way, but bad books can do that too — by provoking you to challenge the arguments and see where they fall apart, or merely by making you spend more time with your own thoughts on an important topic.</p>\n<p>In particular, I like the “one big idea” genre of books — where there’s a useful idea you get from the first chapter, and the rest is basically filler. A common criticism of these books is “this should have just been a magazine article,” which is right on one level and wrong on another.</p>\n<p>One of the books I got the most out of last year was <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38647406-fed-up?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=pe9bmqHGsb&#x26;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Fed Up: Emotional Labor, Women, and the Way Forward</a></em>. This was written because the author’s <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">article on the subject</a> went viral and got a book contract, and it shows — pretty much everything interesting in the book is in the first chapter, which is the original article. But the idea is a really important one: doing household chores themselves is only part of the work; understanding, deciding, and keeping track of what needs to be done (both practically and emotionally) is also a lot of work, and in (heterosexual) relationships that duty generally falls on women in addition to their share of tangible tasks. And by spending several hours reading the book instead of a few minutes scrolling through an article, I got to actually think about that point — what does that look like in my own relationship, and how can I try to do better at recognizing and sharing that mental load.</p>\n<p>If the value of a bad book lies mostly in making you think about the topic yourself, why do you need the book at all instead of just going off and doing your own thinking? A book helps in two ways. First, it provides a change in perspective — seeing new arguments helps you build a better mental model of the topic and think about what makes sense and what doesn’t. Second, it gives you motivation — come on, you aren’t really going to go think about something for a while; you need something to anchor on, and at least in my experience, a book is the best way to get into learning and thinking mode.</p>\n<p>This suggests another strategy for choosing books — one based not on “how good they are” but “how likely they are to inspire useful thoughts for you.” These are correlated (good books are more likely to have better information and better arguments you can adopt) but not always the same. What criteria can you look for in an otherwise bad book to make reading it worthwhile?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It fulfills a need — something you want to think more about. This is why bad time management books work for me; a bad history book probably wouldn’t help much, because I want to learn about history but don’t really want to rethink it myself.</li>\n<li>It gives you some reason to engage with it — such as one interesting fact you saw excerpted, some connection to the author, or a recommendation. if you come in <em>knowing</em> that the book is going to be terrible, you probably won’t get as much out of it, unless you’re really good at <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/steelmanning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">steelmanning</a> others’ arguments.</li>\n<li>It’s a light read — slogging through a bad book that’s also long is probably not going to be fun.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/reading-bad-books","tagSlugs":["/tag/books/","/tag/reading/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-12-21T12:00:00","description":"One of my guilty pleasures is reading books about time management.
