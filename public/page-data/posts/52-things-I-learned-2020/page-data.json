In 1989, Pepsi briefly became (on paper) the world’s sixth-largest military power.

For most of US history, when a sitting vice president died or replaced a president who died, no new vice president was appointed to replace him until the next presidential election cycle. This was the case until Spiro Agnew was removed in the 1970s (even Lyndon Johnson wasn’t replaced in 1963-64). Given the total amount of time in which we didn’t have a vice president (more than 37 years!) and the historical death rate of presidents through the 1960s (once every 23 years), it’s actually quite fortunate that we never had a president die without a VP to take over.

Martin Van Buren’s VP, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mentor_Johnson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Richard Johnson</a>, had an openly recognized relationship and two children with one of his slaves, and he was such an electoral burden that a) faithless electors refused to vote for him as VP, requiring him to be named via the Senate; and b) Van Buren dropped him from the ticket in 1840 and ran for his second term without a VP.

The average human body temperature has fallen by ~1°F since 1860 (to 97.5 degrees, not 98.6), perhaps because we experience less inflammation from diseases [<a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a30459459/body-temperature-decrease/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Popular Mechanics</a>].
