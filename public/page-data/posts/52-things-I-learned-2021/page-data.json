The number of licensed geriatrics doctors in the US fell by 25% from 1996-2010, even as the population aged.

Many of the key researchers of the atomic bomb were really young: Niels Bohr was in his 20s when he developed his atomic model of the atom, and Ernest Rutherford and Enrico Fermi were in their early 30s when they made their respective breakthrough findings on radioactivity; each received a Nobel Prize before turning 40. Leo Szliard filed his patent for the chain reaction that would be at the heart of the nuclear bomb when he was 35. In contrast, the average age of the 17 Nobelists in physics and chemistry over the last three years is over 70 (with the youngest being 52). And research opportunities are going to older and older scientists: in 1980 the majority of lead scientists getting grants funded by the NIH were younger than 40; today most are older than 50.

When <em>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</em> came to Russia, the “Ask the Audience” lifeline became useless because audiences gave the wrong answer out of spite.

The verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure I grew up with is no longer standard in today’s pop songs — they’re instead built around one or multiple “hooks” within a wider variety of song structures.

Western math (mainly from the Greeks) was developed around geometry, so it had no need for zero or negative numbers; Indian and later Arabic math was developed around algebra so zeroes and negatives were critical. Similarly, multiplication was considered one of the most advanced concepts in mathematics by the Romans (because multiplying with Roman numerals is really hard, unlike with the Arabic system when it’s really easy).
