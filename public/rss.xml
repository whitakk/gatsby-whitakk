&lt;li&gt;Until 2011(!), vehicles were only required to use “average male”-proportioned crash test dummies; when female-like dummies were added, many cars’ safety ratings fell.

&lt;li&gt;“Going steady” was controversial in the ’40s and ’50s because (some) adults wanted their children to date more casually, as had been common in the ’20s and ’30s. Catholic schools in 1957 even expelled some students for “seeing one student to the exclusion of all the others.” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114515-labor-of-love&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labor of Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The first silicon transistor company --- whose workers went on to found Fairchild Semiconductor, which in turn spawned many top tech companies --- was founded in the Bay Area mainly because the founder’s sick mother lived there.

&lt;li&gt;The use of “meme” as it relates to internet culture was coined by Mike Godwin writing about the spread of Godwin’s Law in &lt;em&gt;Wired.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739320-because-internet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because Internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The iPhone alone accounts for more than $10B of America’s trade deficit with China. However, traditional trade statistics are misleading here, because the majority of this is value added in other countries (Korea, Japan, etc.) before the product reaches China.

&lt;li&gt;Visa (then BankAmericard) was launched by just giving everyone in Fresno, CA a credit card, forcing merchants to get on board. The program lost $170M in today’s dollars in its first 15 months due to fraud and late payments, but became profitable and entrenched throughout California a few years later.

&lt;li&gt;The oft-cited claim that women’s representation dramatically increased after orchestras switched to “blind” auditions is not really supported by any traceable evidence in the original paper.

&lt;li&gt;It is somewhat well-known that lifespan has become increasingly correlated with income --- however, this trend is completely explained by smoking, which has become more strongly (negatively) correlated with income [&lt;a href=&quot;https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/10/does-us-health-inequality-reflect-income-inequalityor-something-else.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NY Fed&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The “nickel fare” for the subway was a major populist force in NYC politics in the first half of the 20th century. Subway fares remained 5c from its opening in 1904 until 1948 despite 2.5—3x overall price inflation in that span, straining funding for operational improvements.

&lt;li&gt;Digital cameras often store all photos in landscape orientation (even if all devices are smart enough to show them as vertical images), which can trip up computer vision models.

&lt;li&gt;Many conventional financial metrics, like ROE and ROA, are systematically overstated in times of high inflation --- returns grow with inflation but depreciation of assets does not.

&lt;li&gt;Former football players die at a significantly higher rate than other pro athletes --- but contrary to the popular narrative, this is 9a) due to heart disease (perhaps a consequence of being overweight) rather than brain disease, and b) football players’ death rates are no higher than men’s in the general population.

&lt;li&gt;At Harvard Business School, only 1.3% of the Class of 1941 went to Wall Street, and only 6% in the 1960s. 30% do now, more than any other sector.

&lt;li&gt;American academia was initially very focused on applied fields like agriculture: through 1897, only 56 Americans had earned math PhDs, and 73 in physics.

&lt;li&gt;I’m suspicious of data that supports the prevailing narrative so thoroughly, but: when the average Boomer was 35 (in 1989), their cohort owned 21% of all US wealth. For Gen X (in 2008), that share was 8%; Millennials won’t reach that stage until 2023, but right now their share is only 3%.

&lt;li&gt;Part of why rural areas are losing population is just tautological --- places that gain enough population by definition become classified as urban rather than rural.

&lt;li&gt;I consider this speculative but interesting: Girls tend to be perfectionists in school, whereas boys tend to do the minimum needed to succeed --- which may help them be more confident in their abilities and better learn how to calibrate effort in the long run [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/opinion/sunday/girls-school-confidence.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;About the same number of people worked on the 1933 and 1975 King Kong movies, but 15x more people worked on the 2005 edition --- likely reflecting the increased specialization and complexity of film work today.

&lt;li&gt;China has been the leading publisher of AI research for years, but much of it has had a low impact as measured by citations --- but now China is approaching the US in highly cited AI publications as well.

&lt;li&gt;Under ancient Jewish law, if a suspect on trial was unanimously found guilty by all judges, then they were &lt;em&gt;acquitted&lt;/em&gt; --- on the logic that unanimity often indicates some sort of systemic error.

&lt;li&gt;The presidency of the Council of the European Union, which rotates between member countries every six months, always has a corporate sponsor.
