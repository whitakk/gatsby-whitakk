&lt;p&gt;1. Commercial and consumer toilet paper have different specifications and separate supply chains, which led to the early-pandemic shortages. The same is true of a wide range of perhaps surprising products, such as bananas: restaurants and cafeterias order smaller, loose bananas, whereas supermarkets order larger bananas in bunches. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://marker.medium.com/what-everyones-getting-wrong-about-the-toilet-paper-shortage-c812e1358fe0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Marker&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. In 1989, Pepsi briefly became (on paper) the world’s sixth-largest military power. Russia had an arrangement with the company to trade vodka for cola, but when it ran out of vodka it offered the dispensable assets it had on hand instead — seventeen submarines, one cruiser, one frigate, and one destroyer (which Pepsi immediately sold).

&lt;p&gt;3. For most of US history, when a sitting vice president died or replaced a president who died, no new vice president was appointed to replace him until the next presidential election cycle. This was the case until Spiro Agnew was removed in the 1970s (even Lyndon Johnson wasn’t replaced in 1963-64). Given the total amount of time in which we didn’t have a vice president (more than 37 years!) and the historical death rate of presidents through the 1960s (once every 23 years), it’s actually quite fortunate that we never had a president die without a VP to take over.

&lt;p&gt;4. The term “Fallopian Tube” is actually a mistranslation of the Italian term “Fallopian Tuba” (&lt;em&gt;tube&lt;/em&gt; is the plural of &lt;em&gt;tuba&lt;/em&gt; in Italian), so named because the guy who “discovered” them thought they looked like tubas. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube#History&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Solar power costs have fallen by about 80% in the last decade, much faster than the forecasted decline of about 20-30%. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ramez Naam&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. In 1999, a divorcing couple in Las Vegas couldn’t decide how to split up their Beanie Baby collection, so a judge ordered them to conduct a live draft in the courtroom. (Maple the Bear was the first overall pick.) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thejasonkirk/status/1274402791243513861&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@thejasonkirk&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Frederick Douglass was the most photographed person of the 19th century, largely because he intentionally sought out opportunities to pose for photos so Blacks would be portrayed in a realistic light instead of in (often distorted) drawings.

&lt;p&gt;8. Deaths caused by pathogens in the US were increasing well before Covid-19, rising by 60% from 1980-2000. HIV was the biggest factor, but even excluding HIV there was a 22% increase. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23847947-pandemic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. The Seinfeld theme was played on a keyboard, not a real bass, and it was re-recorded for every single episode to optimally fit the timing of Jerry’s intro bit. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chanian/status/1228751230748356608&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. N95 masks don’t work like sieves, they work like spiderwebs attracting particles into their fibers.

&lt;p&gt;11. MLB pitchers made significantly more pickoff attempts this year, plausibly because there was no crowd to boo them for wasting time.

&lt;p&gt;12. Random vice presidential facts: Herbert Hoover’s VP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Curtis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Charles Curtis&lt;/a&gt;, was 3/8 Native American. Woodrow Wilson’s VP, Thomas Marshall, had his office moved out of the White House for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_R._Marshall#Humor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;telling too many bad jokes&lt;/a&gt;. Martin Van Buren’s VP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mentor_Johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Richard Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, had an openly recognized relationship and two children with one of his slaves, and he was such an electoral burden that a) faithless electors refused to vote for him as VP, requiring him to be named via the Senate; and b) Van Buren dropped him from the ticket in 1840 and ran for his second term without a VP. [Wikipedia]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. The average human body temperature has fallen by ~1°F since 1860 (to 97.5 degrees, not 98.6), perhaps because we experience less inflammation from diseases [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a30459459/body-temperature-decrease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Popular Mechanics&lt;/a&gt;]. And body temperature varies by ~1°F during the day, with lower temperatures in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.

&lt;p&gt;15. US automakers produced ~20% of US munitions during WWII (not only vehicles but also machine guns, aircraft engines, etc.). 10% came from General Motors alone, and Ford produced more war material than all of Italy. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152691-freedom-s-forge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Freedom’s Forge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. There is a place in New Jersey that’s farther south than a place in Washington DC. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MattGlassman312/status/1285312997720756228&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@MattGlassman312&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17. In order to distribute the smallpox vaccine around the world in the 19th century, scientists passed it through a chain of sequentially vaccinated people, because there was no better way to store live vaccine at the time than inside humans. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/09/the-distribution-of-vaccines-in-the-19th-century.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#x26;utm_medium=feed&amp;#x26;utm_campaign=Feed%253A%2Bmarginalrevolution%252Ffeed%2B%2528Marginal%2BRevolution%2529&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Marginal Revolution&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18. Contrary to what cartoons say, you can’t actually be fully consumed by quicksand (your legs may sink, but your upper body is less dense than quicksand, so it will float). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/story/how-deadly-is-quicksand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Britannica&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19. The powerful, hard-to-manage, clangy radiators in old NYC apartments were installed in response to the Spanish Flu — they were intended to be powerful enough to keep the space warm even with the windows open in winter, so residents could get natural ventilation. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-05/the-curious-history-of-steam-heat-and-pandemics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20. At least 38% of US traffic deaths occur on rural two-lane roads. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://peterattiamd.com/the-killers-on-the-road-reducing-your-risk-of-automotive-death/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Peter Attia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21. Europeans transmitted deadly diseases to Native Americas — and mostly not the other way around — because the worst diseases spilled over from domesticated animals, of which Native Americas had very few.

&lt;p&gt;22. Tuvalu, an island nation of about 11k, earns about 1/12th of its national incomefrom licensing its “.tv” domain.

&lt;p&gt;23. Deep into the production of Toy Story 2, someone accidentally deleted nearly all files and Pixar’s normal backup system wasn’t working properly; the project was only saved because someone who had just returned from maternity leave and was working from home had an ad-hoc backup on their home computer.

&lt;p&gt;24.

&lt;p&gt;25. No one really knows how eels reproduce and no one has been able to make it happen in a lab (threatening the future of the species).

&lt;p&gt;26. As of the beginning of this year, only one of the Federal Reserve’s 406 economists was a black woman [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/01/07/793855832/economics-still-has-a-diversity-problem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27. Europe didn’t know about fall of the Mongol empire until nearly a century later - Columbus was searching for them on his voyage [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40718726-genghis-khan-and-the-making-of-the-modern-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28. Going through an anxiety-provoking experience is like a “mental vaccination” — you can get partial immunity for similar situations in the future because you remember that one and how it worked out.

&lt;p&gt;29. In 1939, the US had only the 18th largest military in the world. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152691-freedom-s-forge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Freedom’s Forge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30. Hall of Fame baseball player Monte Irvin originally went by Monty, but he changed his spelling after making the major leagues because when signing baseballs his “y” would run into other players’ signatures.

&lt;p&gt;31. Money and markets often first developed around armies — because currency allowed them to be paid far from their home, and as incentive to loot precious metals from conquered territories. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Debt: The First 5,000 Years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32. Two people doing a checklist as a team are more robust to errors than going over it sequentially (e.g. one person does it and the other double-checks it), because the latter method lets each person feel that the other will avoid mistakes.

&lt;p&gt;33. By some estimates, American real estate alone accounts for 20% of all global wealth.

&lt;p&gt;34. AI systems for object recognition are better at classifying objects found in high-income households than those found in low-income households.

&lt;p&gt;35. With no external cues to help them, people who are lost will naturally (accidentally) walk in circles, so they will not end up more than 100 meters from their starting position no matter how long they walk for.

&lt;p&gt;36. The number of businesses in a city scales linearly with population: no matter its size, a city is likely to have roughly one business establishment per 22 residents on average (and eight employees per business). [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31670196-scale&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37. Dogs become moody and emotional during puberty just like humans.

&lt;p&gt;38. Part of the reason why US students perform worse on standardized tests than students in some countries is that they don’t really care — when offered monetary incentives for doing well, they improved significantly (whereas students in Shanghai didn’t the same with or without incentives).

&lt;p&gt;39. From 2005-2019, the average age of new S&amp;#x26;P 500 CEOs increased by 14 years — meaning the exact same generation continued to get the same opportunities even as it aged.

&lt;p&gt;41.

This was a proof of concept for a larger project with the US military aiming to get pigeons to guide missiles to their targets.

&lt;p&gt;44. According to one study, the actual “hurdle rates” (required rate of return) that businesses use when evaluating investments barely changed from 1985-2015, even though yields on corporate debt fell from ~10% to ~4% in that span.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This is for non-fiction books in particular — reading bad fiction can also clearly be a pleasure but I don’t have as much to say about that]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my guilty pleasures is reading books about time management. I consider it a guilty pleasure because I know they have basically the same advice — there are only so many ways to say “put down your phone,” “protect time for focused work,” and “avoid task-switching.” Picking up a book on time management gives me the thrill that the secret to happiness is right around the corner, when in fact the real problem is that I have 30 hours’ worth of things I want to do each day, which won’t be solved by any book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these books, objectively, are even quite bad. Early this year I read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=SwiTY48lAR&amp;#x26;rank=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is written in a really annoying tone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5caaa2520cf57d48aa68f502/1574128726172-YMD8IRRWCLRPN0124MD0/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kG0_wXnvFVYtr8E_VwG1MC17gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0oycmklwMHPwSb2Cr-KYzbquWy9VPGv6wFvhrGUqx6g8NlifStCYa3WZ7XhuX6TLGw/Essentialism+Chart.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;is full of weird drawings&lt;/a&gt;, and has very little actual content — every other Goodreads review ends with the joke “this author should have done less and made this book half as long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I keep reading them — and often taking something useful away from them. &lt;em&gt;Essentialism&lt;/em&gt; helped me internalize that there really is a trade-off in what I do with my time, and that I can’t have it all. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502354-rest?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=b8ICnsD8Zu&amp;#x26;rank=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; pointed me to a useful framework for &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/job.672&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;what it takes to recover from the workweek&lt;/a&gt;. *&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=t6p5TWJven&amp;#x26;rank=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Make Time&lt;/a&gt; *introduced the idea of a “daily highlight” — if you pick one important thing to do today and actually do it, you should be happy with how you spent your time — which I find especially helpful on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can reading bad books be good? It helps to think about the point of reading in the first place. (Again, mainly talking about non-fiction here.) Pure enjoyment is one factor; learning new information is another. But a third is that reading a book can inspire you to rethink things or come up with your own ideas. And this is especially relevant for the book format — reading a book isn’t a very *efficient *way to take in new information (how much will you really remember from a 300-page book a week later?), but the flip side of that is you have more time to think about what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bad” books fall short on the first two dimensions — they aren’t very enjoyable (unless it’s in a perverse way), and they don’t have new or compelling information. But they can still fulfill the third purpose. Yes, “good” writing often helps you think about things in a new way, but bad books can do that too — by provoking you to challenge the arguments and see where they fall apart, or merely by making you spend more time with your own thoughts on an important topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I like the “one big idea” genre of books — where there’s a useful idea you get from the first chapter, and the rest is basically filler. A common criticism of these books is “this should have just been a magazine article,” which is right on one level and wrong on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the books I got the most out of last year was &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38647406-fed-up?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=pe9bmqHGsb&amp;#x26;rank=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fed Up: Emotional Labor, Women, and the Way Forward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This was written because the author’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;article on the subject&lt;/a&gt; went viral and got a book contract, and it shows — pretty much everything interesting in the book is in the first chapter, which is the original article. But the idea is a really important one: doing household chores themselves is only part of the work; understanding, deciding, and keeping track of what needs to be done (both practically and emotionally) is also a lot of work, and in (heterosexual) relationships that duty generally falls on women in addition to their share of tangible tasks. And by spending several hours reading the book instead of a few minutes scrolling through an article, I got to actually think about that point — what does that look like in my own relationship, and how can I try to do better at recognizing and sharing that mental load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the value of a bad book lies mostly in making you think about the topic yourself, why do you need the book at all instead of just going off and doing your own thinking? A book helps in two ways. First, it provides a change in perspective — seeing new arguments helps you build a better mental model of the topic and think about what makes sense and what doesn’t. Second, it gives you motivation — come on, you aren’t really going to go think about something for a while; you need something to anchor on, and at least in my experience, a book is the best way to get into learning and thinking mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests another strategy for choosing books — one based not on “how good they are” but “how likely they are to inspire useful thoughts for you.” These are correlated (good books are more likely to have better information and better arguments you can adopt) but not always the same. What criteria can you look for in an otherwise bad book to make reading it worthwhile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It fulfills a need — something you want to think more about. This is why bad time management books work for me; a bad history book probably wouldn’t help much, because I want to learn about history but don’t really want to rethink it myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives you some reason to engage with it — such as one interesting fact you saw excerpted, some connection to the author, or a recommendation. if you come in &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; that the book is going to be terrible, you probably won’t get as much out of it, unless you’re really good at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/steelmanning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;steelmanning&lt;/a&gt; others’ arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a light read — slogging through a bad book that’s also long is probably not going to be fun.&lt;/li&gt;

But let’s be real, I do it all the time, and you probably do too. You can think of books that confirm or disprove the old saying, but advancements in AI, image recognition algorithms, and crowdsourcing platforms allow us to go beyond anecdotes and analyze this in more detail: can you judge a book by its cover after all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recently as a decade ago, most applications of image recognition were nearly impossible. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/09/09/171446/the-revolutionary-technique-that-quietly-changed-machine-vision-forever/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a 2012 breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; showed that neural networks (now the dominant algorithm used in AI) could recognize images really effectively. Since then, improvements in hardware have made image recognition much more powerful — Google Photos has used it for years to tag faces automatically, and self-driving cars are becoming more than a dream — and software has kept pace to make it much easier to use. Instead of needing PhD in computer science to implement such techniques, now anyone with a bit of coding background can &lt;a href=&quot;https://course.fast.ai/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;take a course online&lt;/a&gt; and create &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/whitakk/fastai_2020/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fnbs%2F02_bear_in_production.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a toy image classification widget&lt;/a&gt; in about three days, and do something new — like attempt to judge books by their covers — with another week or two of tinkering. (For those of you interested in this sort of thing, the code underpinning the rest of this piece is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whitakk/book_covers/blob/master/book_covers_analysis.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the adage, I used GoodReads book reviews as a measure of quality. Picking a useful sample is actually fairly tricky — if you just pick books completely randomly, the vast majority are never reviewed (there are a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of obscure books out there), but if you choose from most-popular lists you’ll be biased toward the best books. I split the difference by finding this list of 10,000 notable books with GoodReads links and ratings, and from there took a random sample of 1,000 of those and downloaded their covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After training an image recognition algorithm (a version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ResNet&lt;/a&gt;) on 800 of the books, then trying to predict the remaining 200 with that model, these are the results: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…which are not so great. There’s no real visible correlation — basically our model predicts every book will get a rating of about 4.0, with very little variation (except one random outlier it doesn’t like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there *anything *useful here? Regression models can be measured by the average squared error, which is .085 here (indicating that the average prediction is off by roughly the square root of .085, or .29 stars). That sounds okay … until we test an alternative method of “just predict the average rating (just under 4.0) every time”, which has an even better squared error of .081! In other words, our model is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inspection of the most extreme predictions in our model doesn’t yield any obvious insights either:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems like the adage is true: you can’t judge a book by its cover! Of course, maybe someone with more than like a dozen hours’ experience of image recognition would do better. But it makes sense that there’s no way to predict a book’s rating from its cover alone. Think of it as an efficient-markets theory — authors and publishers put a lot of time and resources into making their covers as attractive as possible. If there was anything on the cover of some books that predictably signaled they were better, then everyone would want to buy those books — so all the other authors and publishers would copy them, and the signal would be lost. (This only applies to relatively high-profile books — if you included all independent books without any marketing resources, there might be a different story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A matter of taste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;overall quality&lt;/em&gt; is not the only way to judge a book. Even if the cover doesn’t tell you how “good” or “bad” a book is, it might tell you what &lt;em&gt;kind *of book it is — look no further than the recent spate of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2020/08/trump-political-book-covers-trend-sith-lord-palette.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;political tell-alls that all looked the same&lt;/a&gt;. And different people like different kinds of books. So even if you can’t judge if a book is objectively good or bad from its cover, maybe you can judge if it’s right *for you&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand if we can infer the type of book from its cover, I pulled the most common “tags” for each book from GoodReads’ API, filtered for the 20 most popular genres (to eliminate the long tail of rare genres), and trained a new model to predict genres from the cover. (Books could be assigned to more than one genre, e.g. “fiction” and “fantasy”, or “non-fiction” and “biography”, and all genres are just based on user classifications so they are not perfectly consistent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results here were more encouraging: When the model predicted that a book would be a certain genre, it was right 42% of the time; and overall it identified 34% of correct genre assignments. In both cases, a baseline of average guessing (calibrated to the relative prevalence of each genre) would have gotten only 28% right. So our model isn’t great, but it’s better than chance alone — so there’s something in the covers of at least some books that reliably indicates what kind of books they are. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/11/07/69700/deep-neural-network-learns-to-judge-books-by-their-covers/#:~:text=A%20machine%2Dvision%20algorithm%20can,to%20design%20the%20covers%20themselves.&amp;#x26;text=The%20idiom%20%E2%80%9Cnever%20judge%20a,by%20the%20way%20it%20looks.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;An earlier research paper&lt;/a&gt; showed the same.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What information on the cover is our model picking up? Here’s one example: it has clearly learned that the “Penguin Classics” style indicates books in the “Classics” genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;media/books/classics.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;classics&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And “Fantasy” books seem to have colorful covers with a blend of hues. (The accuracy here isn’t great, but you can give it partial credit for #2 if you think of science fiction and fantasy as being adjacent genres.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;media/books/fantasy.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;fantasy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And our model is likely a bit more accurate than the statistics indicate, because some books are not exhaustively labeled. For instance, #1 under “Fiction” here is indeed a fiction book, but it hasn’t been tagged as such on GoodReads (instead tagged as just Mystery and Historical Fiction). If we corrected those errors, we could train the model better and it would also likely score better in evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;media/books/fiction.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;fiction&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;media/books/nonfiction.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;nonfiction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/whitakk/book_covers/master?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fbook_genre_predictor.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;by following this link and uploading a picture&lt;/a&gt; — it will tell you what genres the model predicts for this book. (Note that it takes a little while to load, and may take a couple seconds from when you upload your picture to show results.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it isn’t very useful to predict a book’s genre from the cover, because you usually know that when you’re considering buying it. But it demonstrates that there is information encoded in the cover about what type of book it is, which might apply to dimensions beyond just genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it makes sense that this could work. As mentioned before, if there was something that signaled “this is a great book” it would be adopted everywhere — but something that signals “this is a great book &lt;em&gt;for you,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;if you like books of a certain type&lt;/em&gt;” can’t be adopted everywhere, because it will turn off people who prefer a different type instead. So signaling this way is actually effective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The hot hand fallacy fallacy fallacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[You've probably heard of the hot hand fallacy.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard of the hot hand fallacy. In many areas, but most famously in basketball, people have long believed in the “hot hand”: a player who made their last couple shots was more likely to make the next one as well. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/7782/readings/gilovich%2520vallone%2520tversky.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a famous 1985 study&lt;/a&gt;, analyzing some in-game NBA data and some experiments with Cornell basketball players, found that there was no correlation between previous shots and the outcome of the next one — there was no hot hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s authors, Amos Tversky, became one of the pioneers of behavioral economics (along with Daniel Kahneman), and the hot hand fallacy entered the canon of ways in which we act irrationally — we read patterns from data that is really just random noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fallacy of the fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo published a remarkable paper showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/sv9x2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the 1985 study calculated the hot hand effect wrong&lt;/a&gt;. Their rough analogy: the original study found that after a streak of three made shots, the next shot was no more or less likely to be made. But if you flip a random coin 100 times, then go back and look for streaks of three heads, the probability that the following flip is tails is actually significantly less than 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasoncollins.blog/2018/06/28/explaining-the-hot-hand-fallacy-fallacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;is pretty mind-bending&lt;/a&gt;, and honestly I can’t explain it either, but if you do a little simulation it checks out, and this fact is now pretty well agreed upon among statisticians. If you adjust for this, the 1985 study actually does show evidence of a hot hand — the players made more shots after a streak of made shots than you would have expected from chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all studies are set up the same way, and some find no evidence of a hot hand with methods that don’t require this same type of correction. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_hand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;on balance&lt;/a&gt; the studies that do the math right and have relevant controls generally point to a small hot hand, something like a 2 percentage point increase of making the next shot when you’re on a streak. So, some conclude, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/momentum-isnt-magic-vindicating-the-hot-hand-with-the-mathematics-of-streaks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the practitioners were right all along&lt;/a&gt; and the behavioral scientists were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fallacy of the fallacy of the fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of sports, there are certainly areas where the seemingly smart, non-conventional wisdom has been proven to be incorrect (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://grantland.com/features/studying-art-pitch-framing-catchers-such-francisco-cervelli-chris-stewart-jose-molina-others/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;baseball analysts’ ignorance of pitch-framing skill until recently&lt;/a&gt;). But in this case, while the strict form of the hot hand fallacy now seems to be false, the essential idea still seems to be true — &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacolada.org/88&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;players still greatly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacolada.org/88&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;overestimate&lt;/a&gt; the effect of hotness. In the original study, players (and fans) expected a massive correlation between prior shooting and the next shot, when only a weak one existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grantland.com/the-triangle/biting-the-hot-hand-basketballs-enduring-streakiness-debate-rages-on/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Earlier research by Ezekowitz, Bocskocsky, and Stein&lt;/a&gt; shows how this manifests. By using player-tracking data, they control for the location of where shots are taken and how close the defenders are, and indeed find evidence of a small hot hand. But they also find that players take more difficult shots when they’re hot, presumably because they think they’re much better at those times. This is a rational adjustment on the margin, but the magnitude is quite large — players take such harder shots that their overall shooting percentage actually falls when they’re “hot”. This indicates that they are likely overestimating how much being hot helps, and in doing so probably hurting their team (given that they get more attention from defenders, so their teammates’ shooting percentage would likely increase in these times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with other areas where people read too much into noisy signals, and in particular overrate the extent that streaks can be random. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Try this game&lt;/a&gt; to see how hard it is to mimic random actions — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expunctis.com/2019/04/01/Not-so-random-followup.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;most people can’t&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot hand is relevant this week because of what happened in the final game of the World Series (before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30211683/mlb-justin-turner-disregarded-coronavirus-protocols&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Covid-19 intruded as always&lt;/a&gt;): the Rays took out starter Blake Snell in the sixth inning even though he had not given up a run yet, bringing in a reliever who promptly allowed what turned out to be the game-winning runs. Even before the crucial runs scored, and especially afterward, Rays management was being crucified on Twitter — how could you take out a great pitcher for a reliever that early in the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason was no secret — it’s well-known that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/22156/baseball-proguestus-everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-the-times-through-the-order-penalty/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;pitchers get much worse&lt;/a&gt; when they face the same batter for a third time (the point Snell had just reached), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tangotiger/status/1321471038102867970/photo/1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Snell’s past performance in such situations was worse than Rays’ relievers&lt;/a&gt;. The Rays managed Snell, and all their pitchers, accordingly all season and postseason (Snell never finished the sixth inning in 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, went the reply, but Snell was pitching so well on Tuesday (only two hits and no runs allowed to that point) — he must have been better than usual that day. In other words, he had the hot hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there a hot hand for baseball pitchers — does someone pitching especially well do better late in games than someone pitching just okay? The best research here also finds &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/43230/baseball-therapy-what-craig-counsell-knew-about-wade-miley/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;some evidence of a hot hand, but one that’s very small&lt;/a&gt; — far less than the original gap between Snell and Rays relievers was expected to be. So even adjusting for his performance so far in that game, removing Snell still looks like the sound decision. (It’s possible that some pitchers have more or less propensity for hotness, or that other signals beyond outcomes could be more predictive of hotness, but there’s no evidence either applied to Snell, and in fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-defense-of-kevin-cash-pulling-blake-snell-in-the-world-series/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;more detailed indicators were worrying&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managerial decisions are first- and second-guessed all the time, but what set this one apart was how emotional the reaction was. (If it had been, say, a controversial bunt call, few would have remembered the next day.) But this wasn’t just a controversial decision, it was upsetting — we feel like starters should get to keep pitching when they have a shutout going, and it’s way more fun when they do. That’s absolutely true! But pretending the evidence says something it doesn’t isn’t helpful to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m absolutely happy to entertain a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument that we should expect decision-makers in sports to do the fun thing even when it doesn’t maximize their chances of winning — sports are an entertainment business, after all. But that’s not the discussion that was being had on Tuesday night, and it would require a larger sea change from where we are now.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want starting pitchers to go deeper into games, when the evidence suggests that relievers generally do better, we need to instead change the rules. Maybe this is as simple as forcing teams to have fewer pitchers, thus making the good ones pitch more. Maybe it requires some more out-of-the-box changes (my zany idea is to only allow players who started the game to pitch, which might bring us back 100 years to the era of nine-inning specialists, with the added bonus of seeing more true two-way players). But it’s clear at this point that what’s the most fun is not what gives you the best chance of winning, and MLB should be trying to bring those back into alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[52 things I learned in 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[1.

&lt;li&gt;For all the digital ink spilled by people like me on the importance of taking three-pointers and layups, there is almost no correlation between aggregate shot selection and overall team quality in college basketball.

&lt;li&gt;The voice actor for Siri read every word in the dictionary and didn’t know until later that it became Siri’s voice. She said she got bored during the recording, so Siri “may have an attitude” at times.

&lt;li&gt;On calls with investors in 2018, executives of public American companies mentioned Amazon more often than they mentioned any other company, public or private. They mentioned Amazon more than they mentioned President Trump --- and nearly as much as they mentioned taxes.

&lt;li&gt;Our own brains have two competing systems --- one to create, one to inhibit or question the drive to create (e.g. a stroke survivor with the latter system damaged felt a compulsion to paint everywhere) --- roughly mirroring the structure of Generative Artificial Networks.

&lt;li&gt;TGI Friday’s was born as one of the first singles bars in NYC (at 63rd and 1st), because single women were barred from many bars as late as the 1960s.

&lt;li&gt;Of course, humans can also fight back: Uber and Lyft drivers coordinated with each other to artificially activate surge pricing at Reagan Airport.

&lt;li&gt;The decentralization of power in US urban planning since days of Robert Moses, while directionally a good thing, has left many veto points that make new major infrastructure projects nearly impossible [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/11/29/penn-station-robert-caro-073564&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most kitchen thermometers use an inch-long sensor, so they should only be used for roasts or very thick cuts of meat (knowledge I could’ve used a few years ago when cooking steaks for Valentine’s Day and wondering why the temperature never got above 100F, only to find them totally dry.)

&lt;li&gt;Working with machines rather than humans might change our own behavior accordingly --- for example, programmers may be stereotypically anal and pedantic because they work with computers and compilers, which need every character specified correctly down to the semicolon to operate properly.
