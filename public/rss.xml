&lt;p&gt;1. In the 1980s, 75% of airline accidents happened while the captain (the more senior of the two pilots) was flying the plane. An investigation found this happened because (junior) first officers didn’t feel comfortable pointing out concerns when a superior was in charge; after airlines adopted a protocol with explicit steps on how to raise and confirm acknowledgement of an issue, captains’ share of accidents fell back to 50%. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35629742-meltdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. When Amazon first launched, you could technically order a negative quantity of books and pay negative dollars (meaning they would give you money). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203914304576627102996831200&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Why do the flags of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bangladesh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palau&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Palau&lt;/a&gt; have a circle that’s slightly to the left of center? The loose end of a flag tends to fold up a little when it’s flying, so the off-center version actually looks centered when hung on a flagpole. (Exercise for the reader: at what point in time will emoji flags be seen by more people than physical ones, and how long after that will the circles get re-centered?) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bangladesh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. It is physically impossible to exceed the 70lb weight limit of a USPS small flat rate box: if you filled one to capacity with the densest element on Earth, it would only weigh about 60 pounds. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PaulMSherman/status/1516936733769801734/photo/1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@PaulMSherman&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Everything is economic policy: the popular (though misguided) belief that eating eggs is bad for your cholesterol may date to the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson directed the Surgeon General to publicize that theory in an attempt to control rising inflation by reducing demand for eggs. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tracy-alloway.com/?p=58&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tracy Alloway&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. In Game 2 of the World Series, umpire Pat Hoberg called a “perfect game”: not a single one of his ball or strike calls was contradicted by pitch-tracking data. This was the first time an umpire achieved that in eight seasons of tracking (roughly 14,000 games). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UmpScorecards/status/1586735374985854976&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@UmpScorecards&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Why do the Nobel Prizes exist? When Alfred Nobel’s brother’s death was mistakenly reported as his own, he didn’t like how his obituary only focused on his arms trading business, so he changed his will to endow the prizes as a better legacy. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169354.The_Prize?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=lTKXS8AHmd&amp;#x26;rank=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Instead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://think-boundless.com/the-boomer-blockade/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“Boomer Blockade”&lt;/a&gt; that afflicts politics and business, Hollywood has a Gen-X blockade: the average age of lead actors in popular films rose from ~35 in 2000 to ~50 in 2020. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/movies/2022/6/27/23181232/old-actors-aging-tom-cruise-top-gun-maverick&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Ringer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. “Schrödinger’s cat” was a thought exercise intended to disprove a theory of quantum mechanics — if the theory leads to such a ridiculous scenario, it must not be true. Others agreed with Schrödinger that it was ridiculous, but they disagreed that it must be untrue, so even though Schrödinger hated that theory, he’s now best known for an explanation of how it works.

&lt;p&gt;10. SimCity’s designers initially tried to replicate real cities to-scale, but they found it boring because parking lots took up too much space. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidzipper/status/1566457472843390979?s=11&amp;#x26;t=5OCK5LLTgqv_7qng45SbXQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@DavidZipper&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. A frequently cited stat claims that 17% of prime-age Americans who are at least seven feet tall play in the NBA. But this was calculated by counting NBA players by reported heights (which by convention include shoes) and all Americans by real heights (without shoes). Few NBA players are actually seven feet tall without shoes; if you adjust for that, the correct statistic is probably less than 5%. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3r0ema/busting_the_myth_that_17_of_american_7_footers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Christmas shopping tip: people tend to perceive a gift’s generosity by comparing it to what similar objects usually cost — they’ll feel more grateful for a $45 scarf than for a $55 coat. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/s/M3TJ2fTCzoQq66NBJ/p/3T6p93Mut7G8qdkAs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;LessWrong&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://thediff.co/p/kweichow-moutai-and-corruption-bets?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;#x26;publication_id=19430&amp;#x26;post_id=86160406&amp;#x26;isFreemail=false&amp;#x26;utm_medium=email&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Byrne Hobart&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. Even if babies spend as much time with other caregivers (e.g. daycare) as with their parents, their development is much more strongly correlated with how their parents care for them than with what other caregivers do. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121328-cribsheet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cribsheet&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. Though both American and European researchers contributed to the invention of the light bulb, the US was much faster to adopt electric lighting systems widely, while Europe was more cautious and regulated. This had some downsides — chaotic wiring systems could be deadly, and unconstrained neon advertising was ugly — but also upsides, not only for economic growth but for safety (electricity replaced flammable gas and brightened dark factories). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15792102-the-age-of-edison?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Age of Edison&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. Sit-ups are bad for your spine and don’t strengthen your core very effectively. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/05/sit-ups-crunches-lower-back-pain/639437/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. After the rollout of public libraries around the turn of the 20th century (largely funded by Andrew Carnegie), patents increased by ~10% in towns that got a library compared to similar ones that didn’t. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/5naegooy/release/8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;New Things Under the Sun&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17. Remember in the 2010s when every pop hit also had a random rap bridge? That happened because Billboard counted all versions of a song cumulatively in its chart rankings, so record labels realized they could game that system by releasing the original song, waiting until it plateaued in popularity, then dropping a new “remix version” to push its numbers higher. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hit-parade-music-history-and-music-trivia/id1291058235?i=1000552194002&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hit Parade&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18. Huddling in football was invented by a team of deaf players so they could sign plays to each other without the opponent seeing. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nowiknow.com/the-origins-of-the-football-huddle/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Now I Know&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19. In 2021, Peter Schubert attempted to set a world record by solving a 54,000 piece jigsaw puzzle. After working on it for several hours a day for more than four months, naturally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9396883/Man-set-complete-worlds-largest-jigsaw-discovers-one-54-000-pieces-MISSING.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the final piece went missing&lt;/a&gt;. (The manufacturer eventually heard and sent him a replacement.) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58735004-the-puzzler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Puzzler&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20. Getting renters, auto, or even home insurance online these days is incredibly easy (I often think I’ve done something wrong because I can’t believe anybody would actually insure me for this much without talking to me in person). But life insurance can be completely the opposite — my experience involved doing an in-person physical, getting access to detailed medical records, and sometimes doing follow-ups, a process that can take up to several months — so don’t put it off until you absolutely need it. [personal experience]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21. In 1900, railroads accounted for ~2/3 of US market cap. (For comparison, at the 2021 market peak, even the broadest definition of “tech companies” accounted for 40-45% of the S&amp;#x26;P 500 market cap.) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americas-stock-market-was-dominated-by-one-industry-in-1900-134439952.html?guccounter=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt; via Byrne Hobart]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22. Want to guess the Wordle on the first try? Someone built an algorithm that looks at everyone’s Wordle tweets (which reveal only the outcomes of your guesses, not the words) and identifying the answer that would most likely generate those patterns, based on the most commonly used English words — it’s right well over half the time. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/code/benhamner/wordle-1-6/notebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wordle 1/6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23. At least one NFL team has detailed scouting reports on every referee that includes how fit they are and who trains them, so the team can predict how quickly they’ll get ready for the next play. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://defector.com/how-nfl-teams-scout-the-refs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Defector&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24. At the start of 2020 — the year it developed the world-changing Covid-19 vaccine that it marketed with Pfizer — only ~1% of BioNTech’s ~1000 employees were working on infectious diseases (most of the company was focused on cancer research), and it had never actually brought a product to market in its 12-year history. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58271538-the-vaccine?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_27&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Vaccine&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25. Even if you have a model that predicts future market movements better than chance, you might lose money trading on it — if other people see some of the same signals, they might also try to make the same trade when you’re right (so you can’t always do it), but not when you’re wrong.

&lt;p&gt;26. During the McGwire-Sosa home run chase In 1998, an IRS spokesperson said that if someone caught a record-setting baseball and gave it back to the batter, they would owe the IRS a “gift tax” that would have likely amounted to at least six figures. The IRS later walked that back in a press release, saying the gift tax would be waived; however, if someone catches such a ball and keeps it, it’s still ambiguous today how it would be taxed. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-05/historic-baseballs-are-fan-gold-murkier-for-tax-accountants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.fangraphs.com/effectively-wild-episode-1915-divided-we-ball/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Effectively Wild&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27. Most emoji scissors wouldn’t actually close far enough to cut anything. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://wh0.github.io/2020/01/02/scissors.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;wh0&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28. Stuck with a non-transferrable plane ticket that you can’t use? One person reportedly got around this by calling the airline, saying “oops, I misspelled my name, can you change this letter to that one”, and repeating the process for every letter of their name until it said a friend’s name instead. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1486425890535870467/photo/1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@danluu&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29. Some competitive speed-typists use alternate fingerings for certain letter combinations — for example, although they might use their middle finger to type “e” or “d” in isolation, they’ll use the index finger on the latter when typing “ed”, because having the same finger hop from one key to another wastes time. This makes a lot of sense in theory (as an analogy, when learning to play piano I was taught to move my hands across the keyboard to play sequences of notes with different fingers, not to keep the same fingers on the same keys all the time) — but I practiced that “ed” combination on and off for a month and was still much slower than usual, probably because the standard way is too ingrained in my muscle memory.

&lt;p&gt;31. In 1998-2008, the top 1% of global earners famously had the fastest income growth (with both the very poorest people worldwide and middle classes of developed countries falling behind). But new data shows that in 2008-18 that pattern disappeared: the top 1% experienced the slowest growth, and incomes grew faster almost uniformly as you go down the income spectrum (in other words, global income inequality fell significantly in that decade).

&lt;p&gt;32. It’s possible for an NFL team to throw two forward passes on one play — the second pass is ordinarily nullified by a penalty, but if the outcome is better for the defense, they can choose to decline the penalty and let the pass stand instead. (Naturally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/tom-brady-double-pass-buccaneers-rams/17be1kmajmf991nasyjdxhzi65&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tom Brady has done this already&lt;/a&gt;.)

&lt;p&gt;33. Google’s “emotion recognition” dataset — sentences paired with labels like “joy”, “sadness” or “neutral” used to train natural language processing models — is wrong about 30% of the time, according to one study. They posit this is because the (outsourced) human labelers didn’t have enough context and didn’t understand modern American usage of phrases — for example, they labeled LETS FUCKING GOOOOO as “angry” rather than something more appropriate like “excited.” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/30-percent-of-googles-reddit-emotions-dataset-is-mislabeled&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Surge AI&lt;/a&gt;, not exactly an impartial source, but the analysis and explanation seem credible]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34. Pop Rocks were invented when a brainstorming session to come up with crazy ideas resulted in “talking candy.” Scientists in the room realized that they knew of a way to sort of make that happen, and the rest was history.

&lt;p&gt;35. Historically, Saudi Arabia has stood out from other OPEC countries by generally pushing to produce more oil to keep prices low. This may be because it has more oil reserves, so it’s more concerned about long-term factors — keeping prices low reduces profits in the short term, but it makes it more likely in the long run that importers will keep using oil instead of shifting to other sources of energy.

&lt;p&gt;36. “Male” and “female” come from totally different root words and it’s a coincidence that they look the same. (Also true for “pen” and “pencil”, and “house” and “penthouse”.)

&lt;p&gt;37. Rubik’s Cube initially marketed its product as having “over 3 billion combinations.” The actual number is 43 quintillion — 10000000000 times higher! — but they figured people wouldn’t even understand what such a big number meant, so they rounded way down.

&lt;p&gt;38. Amazon’s Kindle project was directly inspired by iTunes; digital music eroded the company’s business in selling CDs, and it didn’t want the same to happen in books. (Related: as of 2016, e-books accounted for more than half of romance novel sales, 30-45% for other fiction, 10-30% for nonfiction, and only 5% for kids’ books.)

&lt;p&gt;39. Nature, generally regarded as the most prestigious scientific journal today, hasn’t been that way for very long — it wasn’t peer-reviewed until the 1970s, and in the first ranking of journals by “impact factor” around that time it placed 109th.

&lt;p&gt;40. Most home economics programs in the early 20th century required several biology and chemistry courses, but not other sciences such as physics, perhaps contributing to modern gender ratio differences across fields.

&lt;p&gt;41. History is surprisingly contingent: Marvin Miller, whose aggressive negotiation for the MLB Players’ Association paved the way for free agency and an explosion in salaries across sports, wasn’t the players’ first choice when he was hired in 1966 — they offered the job to the incumbent part-time head Robert Cannon, who wanted to take a much softer stance, but Cannon rejected it because he didn’t want to move to New York or Chicago.

&lt;p&gt;42.

&lt;p&gt;47. A large-scale study of consumer goods found that the “pink tax” seems to be a myth — women’s products are more expensive for some goods and men’s products for others, but there’s not much aggregate difference.

What I mean by opponent elasticity is how much worse an offense gets when they play a better defense. In particular, I suspected that a team that always takes lots of difficult shots (like UCLA, which attempted more long two-pointers than any other tournament teams and made a lot of them) might do almost as well against good defenses as against bad ones, because there’s no real way for anyone to stop them from taking tough shots. In contrast, teams that pass the ball well to get easy shots might be even better against bad opponents but struggle more against good ones that are disciplined and athletic enough to take away easy shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Betterige’s Law&lt;/a&gt; holds here: although there are some non-random differences in “opponent elasticities”, they’re so small that they have basically no practical value, and they don’t strongly correlate with any measures of offensive style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re still interested in reading further…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://barttorvik.com/#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bart Torvik’s T-Rank ratings site&lt;/a&gt; has game-by-game offensive and defensive efficiency data for all Division I games going back to 2008, as well as adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency for each game. That allowed me to calculate two metrics for each team in each game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raw offensive efficiency (points scored per 100 possessions), adjusted for home-court advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average adjusted defensive efficiency &lt;em&gt;in every other game that season&lt;/em&gt; (points allowed per 100 possessions, controlling for opponent strength, but removing the impact of the game in question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you ever want to use Torvik’s raw data for analysis, see his post here for &lt;a href=&quot;http://adamcwisports.blogspot.com/p/data.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;easy download links&lt;/a&gt; that don’t involve messy and unkind web-scraping.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this data, I calculated each team’s “opponent elasticity” over the course of each season by finding the slope of the regression line for offensive efficiency against opponent other-game defensive efficiency. This slope represents how much a team’s offensive efficiency increased/decreased when playing better/worse defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median team has an opponent elasticity of about 1.0 — for every point worse the opponent’s adjusted defensive efficiency is, your team’s offense is expected to be one point more efficient against them. (If that wasn’t the case, something would be wrong, because that’s exactly how adjusted efficiency is defined!) However, there’s a wide variation of elasticities between teams: 15% had elasticities below 0.5, and 2% even had negative elasticities — they were &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; efficient, on average, against better defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the most extreme opponent elasticities in 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But college basketball seasons are short, and this metric is noisy: in the Little Rock example above, you can see the negative elasticity is mostly driven by a single game, when they had one of the most efficient performances of the season against Arkansas, by far the best defense they played. Is there true variation between teams in their opponent elasticities, or is what we observe here just noise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to assess this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://statspeakmvn.wordpress.com/2008/01/06/on-the-reliability-of-pitching-stats/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;split-half reliability&lt;/a&gt; — if we split each team’s season into two half-seasons, one with odd-numbered games and one with evens, are the two halves correlated? (Odds vs evens is better here than first-half vs second-half because most teams’ strength of schedule is much different in conference play compared to non-conference play.) When we measure the elasticity in each half and compare, the results are … underwhelming:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see at this scale, but there is a small correlation (r=.05), and with more than 5,000 team-seasons in our sample, we can actually find small effects. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/03/23/yes-i-really-really-really-like-fake-data-simulation-and-i-cant-stop-talking-about-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;fake-data simulation&lt;/a&gt; helps us see if this is a real small effect or just noise. An easy way to do that here is to shuffle all of the observed half-season-betas across teams, divide them randomly into two “first-half” and “second-half” lists, and measure the correlation between them; the average correlation will of course be zero, but if this often gives us correlations stronger than .05, what we saw was probably noise. However, 1000 such simulations never give us a correlation quite as strong as the one we’ve observed, so it seems there is some real, albeit small, persistence in a team’s elasticity between halves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How small, though? The value of opponent elasticity is that, by knowing that some offenses are more or less elastic, we might be able to make better predictions about the next game than the generic adjusted efficiency numbers would tell us. Given our findings, could we make any use of this factor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The regression line above has a slope of .05, which means that if a team has zero elasticity halfway through the season (efficiency completely uncorrelated with opponent), the best estimate of their elasticity in the second half of the season is .95, instead of the 1.0 you’d expect for the average team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best defenses are usually about 15 points per 100 possessions better than average, so if you’re about to face the best defense in basketball, applying the lower elasticity increases projected offensive efficiency by 15*.05 = .75 points per 100 possessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;College games are usually about 65-70 possessions, so that rounds to about 0.5 points per game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.5 points per game isn’t meaningless in forecasting, but it’s getting pretty close, and that’s for one of the most extreme cases — in most games the impact would probably be less than a tenth of a point. So although the differences in opponent elasticity between offenses may be statistically significant, they’re practically insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, back to the original hypothesis, no single stylistic factor has a high correlation with opponent elasticity. The only factor that’s strongly correlated with opponent elasticity is how good your offense is overall (adjusted offensive efficiency) — better offenses have lower elasticities — although even here the effect is small (the best/worst offenses have average elasticities of about .95/1.05). If you squint at the other factors, it kind of seems like teams that take more shots at the rim have higher elasticities, but it’s not very reliable, and the impact would be even smaller. For teams that take lots of long twos, they don’t seem to be any more or less elastic than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The number of licensed geriatrics doctors in the US fell by 25% from 1996-2010, even as the population aged. Generalists can provide elder care, of course, but at last one RCT showed that patients that see a geriatric specialist have better outcomes than those seeing a generalist.

&lt;p&gt;2. Many of the key researchers of the atomic bomb were really young: Niels Bohr was in his 20s when he developed his atomic model of the atom, and Ernest Rutherford and Enrico Fermi were in their early 30s when they made their respective breakthrough findings on radioactivity; each received a Nobel Prize before turning 40. Leo Szliard filed his patent for the chain reaction that would be at the heart of the nuclear bomb when he was 35. In contrast, the average age of the 17 Nobelists in physics and chemistry over the last three years is over 70 (with the youngest being 52). And research opportunities are going to older and older scientists: in 1980 the majority of lead scientists getting grants funded by the NIH were younger than 40; today most are older than 50.

&lt;p&gt;3. Even among pregnancies assessed to be healthy at six weeks, 10% eventually end in miscarriage.

Ours happened at nearly 10 weeks, at which point the miscarriage rate is in the low single digits. We later learned the cause was triploidy, where there is an extra full set of chromosomes.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. One out of every six members of the “top 1%” in the US is a doctor or dentist; only 1 in 20 works in tech.

&lt;p&gt;5. 75% of tea’s caffeine is extracted into the water within 30 seconds of steeping — oversteeping makes the taste bitter but doesn’t really make it more caffeinated.

&lt;p&gt;6. As of August, Puerto Rico had a higher vaccination rate than any US state. It’s since been narrowly surpassed by Vermont, but it’s still above everyone else. (Obligatory caveat that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/cdc-revises-data-overcounting-number-vaccinations-29816191-c921-4942-bdd4-879b24f172f6.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the quality of our people-vaccinated data is terrible&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven’t seen anything suggesting PR is specifically skewed.)

&lt;p&gt;7. A good bowling ball is not uniformly filled inside (even excluding the finger holes) — more mass is concentrated in the center so it spins faster, and it’s weighted asymmetrically so that the axis on which it spins is constantly changing, coating the ball evenly with oil from the lane.

&lt;p&gt;9. Children are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; less likely to have severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults — according to UK data, even unvaccinated children were at lower risk of death than vaccinated adults of any age. (This was in the time before children could be vaccinated so it was pre-Omicron and mostly pre-boosters, which both lowered the risk to adults, but I’d bet on it still being true today.)

&lt;p&gt;10. When &lt;em&gt;Who Wants to be a Millionaire&lt;/em&gt; came to Russia, the “Ask the Audience” lifeline became useless because audiences gave the wrong answer out of spite. In France they were usually more cooperative, unless they thought the question was too easy and the contestant should have known it themselves.

&lt;p&gt;12. The verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure I grew up with is no longer standard in today’s pop songs — they’re instead built around one or multiple “hooks” within a wider variety of song structures. That’s not the first such transition; the verse-chorus form itself only became popular in the 1960s, supplanting the “AABA” form more popular in the jazz age.

&lt;p&gt;13. Western math (mainly from the Greeks) was developed around geometry, so it had no need for zero or negative numbers; Indian and later Arabic math was developed around algebra so zeroes and negatives were critical. Similarly, multiplication was considered one of the most advanced concepts in mathematics by the Romans (because multiplying with Roman numerals is really hard, unlike with the Arabic system when it’s really easy).

&lt;p&gt;21. Domestic US airlines have had only one accident-related fatality in the last 12 years — mainly by going through flight data and finding safety lessons from every actual or potential mistake. (Technological improvements have also helped, but those have also been adopted internationally, where the safety record is improving but not as strong.)

&lt;p&gt;23. ‘Pakistan’ is an acronym (for Punjab, Afghan Border States, Kashmir, Sindh and Baluchistan). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1438725452848242694&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@Noahpinion&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24. Historic milestones weren’t always so popular at the time, in two parts: Some French despised the look of the Eiffel Tower when it was first built, calling it the “metal asparagus.” And according to at least some polls, a narrow majority of Americans in the 1960s opposed the level of spending on the man-on-the-moon effort.

&lt;p&gt;25. The Yankees (still named the Highlanders at the time) were moved from Baltimore to New York to spite former manager John McGraw, who left the franchise midseason to join the New York Giants and took a few players with him. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28129746-baseball-s-power-shift?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=3Rj0hu8MYV&amp;#x26;rank=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Baseball’s Power Shift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26. Sirens on emergency vehicles have little benefit — most studies show they save less than one minute, or at most three minutes, per trip — and they cause significant downsides, such as riskier driving by emergency responders, erratic driving by others, and hearing loss.

&lt;p&gt;27. People spend $400M per year on table saws, which cause $4B per year in injury damage. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/21/02/the-table-saw-that-wont-cut-your-fingers-off&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kottke&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28. In the US and many other countries, people’s self-reported happiness didn’t really fall during the pandemic. I’m always rather skeptical of happiness studies, but this does fit with other research on “hedonic adaptation” — most people quickly get used to whatever their circumstances are. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2021/03/20/the-pandemic-has-changed-the-shape-of-global-happiness?utm_campaign=the-economist-this-week&amp;#x26;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;#x26;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;#x26;utm_term=2021-03-18&amp;#x26;utm_content=ed-picks-article-link-6&amp;#x26;etear=nl_weekly_6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29. Nike was ahead of its time as a “move fast and break things” company in the 1970s — it focused on massive growth at the expense of cash and nearly failed several times; it often operated in contractual grey areas; and it had a fratty, inexperienced leadership team. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27220736-shoe-dog?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=NpL6nMlX8R&amp;#x26;rank=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Shoe Dog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30. The massive clouds of “smoke” surrounding a spaceship as it launches are actually steam — a massive amount of water is sent under the rocket at liftoff to absorb the sound waves and prevent them from breaking the rocket itself. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://nowiknow.com/why-spaceships-need-a-foot-bath/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Now I Know&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31. “Pasta in tomato sauce” and “fried ice cream” were invented only a decade apart (though the latter was originally ice cream wrapped in fried dough, not itself fried).

&lt;p&gt;32. In Oaxaca, December 23 is the “Night of the Radishes,” in which people make oversized sculptures out of carved radishes.

&lt;p&gt;33. &lt;em&gt;Controlling for SAT scores&lt;/em&gt;, admission rates to Ivy-plus schools are roughly constant across the bottom 90% of the income distribution but rise rapidly and continuously within the top 10%.

&lt;p&gt;34. Most wasabi served in Japanese restaurants in the West isn’t actually wasabi but dyed horseradish powder.

&lt;p&gt;35. Amazon found its famous “two-pizza team” structure was ineffective for non-product functions, and even for product teams it’s since relaxed the strict size constraint.

&lt;p&gt;36. The longest border France has with any country is Brazil (via French Guiana). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1337489409554276352&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@TrungTPhan&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37. According to Orson Welles, in the early days of cinemas, movies would be shown on loop and patrons would enter whenever they arrived at the theater, not necessarily at the start of the film (kind of like walking into one of those short films at a museum). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/21/09/one-complaint-per-table&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kottke&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;38. Mendel’s discovery of how genetic traits are inherited was barely noticed at the time and not popularized for nearly 50 years.

&lt;p&gt;39. The first “wearable computer” was developed by Ed Thorp and Claude Shannon in the 1960s to predict with better-than-chance accuracy the resting place of a roulette ball. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733505-a-man-for-all-markets?ac=1&amp;#x26;from_search=true&amp;#x26;qid=8GIXTElIAJ&amp;#x26;rank=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;A Man for All Markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40. The share of US economic activity coming from the top five metropolitan areas was lower in 2018 than it was in 1969. This is mainly because population growth in those cities is stagnant, even as per-capita incomes continue to grow. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/upshot/rich-city-poor-city-population-growth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Upshot&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41. We usually think of established experts as holding onto existing theories for too long and impeding progress (“science advances one funeral at a time”), but when a potential new finding in particle physics came out earlier this year, most quoted scientists were hoping the old paradigm would be proven wrong, basically because their research would be too boring otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;42. Firehouse poles were implemented because curious horses (in the days before trucks) kept wandering up the stairs and couldn’t get back down.

&lt;p&gt;43. Baseballs travel farthest when hit 10 degrees to the pull side of centerfield, because that’s the angle that minimizes sidespin (thus minimizing air drag). [&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=http%3A%2F%2Fbaseball.physics.illinois.edu%2Fcarry-v2.pdf&amp;#x26;clen=1749665&amp;#x26;chunk=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alan Nathan&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44. Former NYC Parks Commissioner Henry Jordan Stern, an eccentric city official who was obsessed with animal themes in architecture, required all playgrounds renovated or built during his 15-year tenure to have at least one animal-themed play sculpture.

&lt;p&gt;46. There’s a recent study that makes the rounds on Twitter every few months purporting to show that people hate being alone with their thoughts so much that &lt;a href=&quot;https://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/WILSON%20ET%20AL%202014.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;they’re willing to give themselves painful electric shocks to avoid it&lt;/a&gt;. But most participants actually reported that the thinking time was somewhat enjoyable, they were just too curious about what the shock would be like.

&lt;p&gt;47. Older siblings have an average IQ 2.3 points higher than younger siblings.

&lt;p&gt;48. Three Musketeers was introduced in 1932 as a set that also included vanilla and strawberry bars, so the name actually made sense.

&lt;p&gt;49. 16-digit credit card numbers are actually a 15-digit number plus a “check digit” — which is related to the other 15 digits with a complex formula such that it will not match if there is a typo in any one of them (allowing the number to be easily detected as invalid).

&lt;p&gt;50. “Mayday” is just an Anglicized spelling of “m’aidez” (“help me” in French). [&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katelynthomas/status/1368020994473009160&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@katelynthomas&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;51. Goaltending in basketball was legal until 1944, because nobody actually tried to do it until then.

&lt;p&gt;1. Commercial and consumer toilet paper have different specifications and separate supply chains, which led to the early-pandemic shortages. The same is true of a wide range of perhaps surprising products, such as bananas: restaurants and cafeterias order smaller, loose bananas, whereas supermarkets order larger bananas in bunches. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://marker.medium.com/what-everyones-getting-wrong-about-the-toilet-paper-shortage-c812e1358fe0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Marker&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. In 1989, Pepsi briefly became (on paper) the world’s sixth-largest military power. Russia had an arrangement with the company to trade vodka for cola, but when it ran out of vodka it offered the dispensable assets it had on hand instead — seventeen submarines, one cruiser, one frigate, and one destroyer (which Pepsi immediately sold).

&lt;p&gt;3. For most of US history, when a sitting vice president died or replaced a president who died, no new vice president was appointed to replace him until the next presidential election cycle. This was the case until Spiro Agnew was removed in the 1970s (even Lyndon Johnson wasn’t replaced in 1963-64). Given the total amount of time in which we didn’t have a vice president (more than 37 years!) and the historical death rate of presidents through the 1960s (once every 23 years), it’s actually quite fortunate that we never had a president die without a VP to take over.

&lt;p&gt;4. The term “Fallopian Tube” is actually a mistranslation of the Italian term “Fallopian Tuba” (&lt;em&gt;tube&lt;/em&gt; is the plural of &lt;em&gt;tuba&lt;/em&gt; in Italian), so named because the guy who “discovered” them thought they looked like tubas.

&lt;p&gt;5. Solar power costs have fallen by about 80% in the last decade, much faster than the forecasted decline of about 20-30%.

&lt;p&gt;6. In 1999, a divorcing couple in Las Vegas couldn’t decide how to split up their Beanie Baby collection, so a judge ordered them to conduct a live draft in the courtroom. (Maple the Bear was the first overall pick.)

&lt;p&gt;7. Frederick Douglass was the most photographed person of the 19th century, largely because he intentionally sought out opportunities to pose for photos so Blacks would be portrayed in a realistic light instead of in (often distorted) drawings.

But let’s be real, I do it all the time, and you probably do too. You can think of books that confirm or disprove the old saying, but advancements in AI, image recognition algorithms, and crowdsourcing platforms allow us to go beyond anecdotes and analyze this in more detail: can you judge a book by its cover after all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recently as a decade ago, most applications of image recognition were nearly impossible. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/09/09/171446/the-revolutionary-technique-that-quietly-changed-machine-vision-forever/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a 2012 breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; showed that neural networks (now the dominant algorithm used in AI) could recognize images really effectively. Since then, improvements in hardware have made image recognition much more powerful — Google Photos has used it for years to tag faces automatically, and self-driving cars are becoming more than a dream — and software has kept pace to make it much easier to use. Instead of needing PhD in computer science to implement such techniques, now anyone with a bit of coding background can &lt;a href=&quot;https://course.fast.ai/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;take a course online&lt;/a&gt; and create &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/whitakk/fastai_2020/master?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fnbs%2F02_bear_in_production.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a toy image classification widget&lt;/a&gt; in about three days, and do something new — like attempt to judge books by their covers — with another week or two of tinkering. (For those of you interested in this sort of thing, the code underpinning the rest of this piece is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whitakk/book_covers/blob/master/book_covers_analysis.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the adage, I used GoodReads book reviews as a measure of quality. Picking a useful sample is actually fairly tricky — if you just pick books completely randomly, the vast majority are never reviewed (there are a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of obscure books out there), but if you choose from most-popular lists you’ll be biased toward the best books. I split the difference by finding this list of 10,000 notable books with GoodReads links and ratings, and from there took a random sample of 1,000 of those and downloaded their covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After training an image recognition algorithm (a version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ResNet&lt;/a&gt;) on 800 of the books, then trying to predict the remaining 200 with that model, these are the results: &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…which are not so great. There’s no real visible correlation — basically our model predicts every book will get a rating of about 4.0, with very little variation (except one random outlier it doesn’t like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there *anything *useful here? Regression models can be measured by the average squared error, which is .085 here (indicating that the average prediction is off by roughly the square root of .085, or .29 stars). That sounds okay … until we test an alternative method of “just predict the average rating (just under 4.0) every time”, which has an even better squared error of .081! In other words, our model is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inspection of the most extreme predictions in our model doesn’t yield any obvious insights either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/c5f3ac92c5a5eeee21eb446ab4a731e5/ratings_high.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ratings-high&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/abddc827cdfb227b8085868df41abb7a/ratings_low.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ratings-low&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems like the adage is true: you can’t judge a book by its cover! Of course, maybe someone with more than like a dozen hours’ experience of image recognition would do better. But it makes sense that there’s no way to predict a book’s rating from its cover alone. Think of it as an efficient-markets theory — authors and publishers put a lot of time and resources into making their covers as attractive as possible. If there was anything on the cover of some books that predictably signaled they were better, then everyone would want to buy those books — so all the other authors and publishers would copy them, and the signal would be lost. (This only applies to relatively high-profile books — if you included all independent books without any marketing resources, there might be a different story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A matter of taste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;overall quality&lt;/em&gt; is not the only way to judge a book. Even if the cover doesn’t tell you how “good” or “bad” a book is, it might tell you what *kind *of book it is — look no further than the recent spate of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2020/08/trump-political-book-covers-trend-sith-lord-palette.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;political tell-alls that all looked the same&lt;/a&gt;. And different people like different kinds of books. So even if you can’t judge if a book is objectively good or bad from its cover, maybe you can judge if it’s right &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand if we can infer the type of book from its cover, I pulled the most common “tags” for each book from GoodReads’ API, filtered for the 20 most popular genres (to eliminate the long tail of rare genres), and trained a new model to predict genres from the cover. (Books could be assigned to more than one genre, e.g. “fiction” and “fantasy”, or “non-fiction” and “biography”, and all genres are just based on user classifications so they are not perfectly consistent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results here were more encouraging: When the model predicted that a book would be a certain genre, it was right 42% of the time; and overall it identified 34% of correct genre assignments. In both cases, a baseline of average guessing (calibrated to the relative prevalence of each genre) would have gotten only 28% right. So our model isn’t great, but it’s better than chance alone — so there’s something in the covers of at least some books that reliably indicates what kind of books they are. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/11/07/69700/deep-neural-network-learns-to-judge-books-by-their-covers/#:~:text=A%20machine%2Dvision%20algorithm%20can,to%20design%20the%20covers%20themselves.&amp;#x26;text=The%20idiom%20%E2%80%9Cnever%20judge%20a,by%20the%20way%20it%20looks.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;An earlier research paper&lt;/a&gt; showed the same.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What information on the cover is our model picking up? Here’s one example: it has clearly learned that the “Penguin Classics” style indicates books in the “Classics” genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/ff09b329ffb2ef6374658c6b5cfd110d/classics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;classics&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And “Fantasy” books seem to have colorful covers with a blend of hues. (The accuracy here isn’t great, but you can give it partial credit for #2 if you think of science fiction and fantasy as being adjacent genres.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/fd85a5410e42b75bbd27ff61214aa50c/fantasy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fantasy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And our model is likely a bit more accurate than the statistics indicate, because some books are not exhaustively labeled. For instance, #1 under “Fiction” here is indeed a fiction book, but it hasn’t been tagged as such on GoodReads (instead tagged as just Mystery and Historical Fiction). If we corrected those errors, we could train the model better and it would also likely score better in evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/c7d536e4d1258da05ad117c6f6142cff/fiction.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fiction&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/a94247d05db3a8cbbb8f0b2fd6c124fb/nonfiction.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nonfiction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/whitakk/book_covers/master?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fbook_genre_predictor.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;by following this link and uploading a picture&lt;/a&gt; — it will tell you what genres the model predicts for this book. (Note that it takes a little while to load, and may take a couple seconds from when you upload your picture to show results.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it isn’t very useful to predict a book’s genre from the cover, because you usually know that when you’re considering buying it. But it demonstrates that there is information encoded in the cover about what type of book it is, which might apply to dimensions beyond just genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it makes sense that this could work. As mentioned before, if there was something that signaled “this is a great book” it would be adopted everywhere — but something that signals “this is a great book &lt;em&gt;for you,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;if you like books of a certain type&lt;/em&gt;” can’t be adopted everywhere, because it will turn off people who prefer a different type instead. So signaling this way is actually effective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The hot hand fallacy fallacy fallacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[You've probably heard of the hot hand fallacy.

In many areas, but most famously in basketball, people have long believed in the “hot hand”: a player who made their last couple shots was more likely to make the next one as well. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/7782/readings/gilovich%2520vallone%2520tversky.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a famous 1985 study&lt;/a&gt;, analyzing some in-game NBA data and some experiments with Cornell basketball players, found that there was no correlation between previous shots and the outcome of the next one — there was no hot hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s authors, Amos Tversky, became one of the pioneers of behavioral economics (along with Daniel Kahneman), and the hot hand fallacy entered the canon of ways in which we act irrationally — we read patterns from data that is really just random noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fallacy of the fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo published a remarkable paper showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/sv9x2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the 1985 study calculated the hot hand effect wrong&lt;/a&gt;. Their rough analogy: the original study found that after a streak of three made shots, the next shot was no more or less likely to be made. But if you flip a random coin 100 times, then go back and look for streaks of three heads, the probability that the following flip is tails is actually significantly less than 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasoncollins.blog/2018/06/28/explaining-the-hot-hand-fallacy-fallacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;is pretty mind-bending&lt;/a&gt;, and honestly I can’t explain it either, but if you do a little simulation it checks out, and this fact is now pretty well agreed upon among statisticians. If you adjust for this, the 1985 study actually does show evidence of a hot hand — the players made more shots after a streak of made shots than you would have expected from chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all studies are set up the same way, and some find no evidence of a hot hand with methods that don’t require this same type of correction. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_hand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;on balance&lt;/a&gt; the studies that do the math right and have relevant controls generally point to a small hot hand, something like a 2 percentage point increase of making the next shot when you’re on a streak. So, some conclude, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/momentum-isnt-magic-vindicating-the-hot-hand-with-the-mathematics-of-streaks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the practitioners were right all along&lt;/a&gt; and the behavioral scientists were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fallacy of the fallacy of the fallacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of sports, there are certainly areas where the seemingly smart, non-conventional wisdom has been proven to be incorrect (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://grantland.com/features/studying-art-pitch-framing-catchers-such-francisco-cervelli-chris-stewart-jose-molina-others/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;baseball analysts’ ignorance of pitch-framing skill until recently&lt;/a&gt;). But in this case, while the strict form of the hot hand fallacy now seems to be false, the essential idea still seems to be true — &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacolada.org/88&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;players still greatly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacolada.org/88&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;overestimate&lt;/a&gt; the effect of hotness. In the original study, players (and fans) expected a massive correlation between prior shooting and the next shot, when only a weak one existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grantland.com/the-triangle/biting-the-hot-hand-basketballs-enduring-streakiness-debate-rages-on/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Earlier research by Ezekowitz, Bocskocsky, and Stein&lt;/a&gt; shows how this manifests. By using player-tracking data, they control for the location of where shots are taken and how close the defenders are, and indeed find evidence of a small hot hand. But they also find that players take more difficult shots when they’re hot, presumably because they think they’re much better at those times. This is a rational adjustment on the margin, but the magnitude is quite large — players take such harder shots that their overall shooting percentage actually falls when they’re “hot”. This indicates that they are likely overestimating how much being hot helps, and in doing so probably hurting their team (given that they get more attention from defenders, so their teammates’ shooting percentage would likely increase in these times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with other areas where people read too much into noisy signals, and in particular overrate the extent that streaks can be random. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Try this game&lt;/a&gt; to see how hard it is to mimic random actions — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expunctis.com/2019/04/01/Not-so-random-followup.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;most people can’t&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot hand is relevant this week because of what happened in the final game of the World Series (before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30211683/mlb-justin-turner-disregarded-coronavirus-protocols&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Covid-19 intruded as always&lt;/a&gt;): the Rays took out starter Blake Snell in the sixth inning even though he had not given up a run yet, bringing in a reliever who promptly allowed what turned out to be the game-winning runs. Even before the crucial runs scored, and especially afterward, Rays management was being crucified on Twitter — how could you take out a great pitcher for a reliever that early in the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason was no secret — it’s well-known that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/22156/baseball-proguestus-everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-the-times-through-the-order-penalty/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;pitchers get much worse&lt;/a&gt; when they face the same batter for a third time (the point Snell had just reached), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tangotiger/status/1321471038102867970/photo/1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Snell’s past performance in such situations was worse than Rays’ relievers&lt;/a&gt;. The Rays managed Snell, and all their pitchers, accordingly all season and postseason (Snell never finished the sixth inning in 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, went the reply, but Snell was pitching so well on Tuesday (only two hits and no runs allowed to that point) — he must have been better than usual that day. In other words, he had the hot hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there a hot hand for baseball pitchers — does someone pitching especially well do better late in games than someone pitching just okay? The best research here also finds &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/43230/baseball-therapy-what-craig-counsell-knew-about-wade-miley/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;some evidence of a hot hand, but one that’s very small&lt;/a&gt; — far less than the original gap between Snell and Rays relievers was expected to be. So even adjusting for his performance so far in that game, removing Snell still looks like the sound decision. (It’s possible that some pitchers have more or less propensity for hotness, or that other signals beyond outcomes could be more predictive of hotness, but there’s no evidence either applied to Snell, and in fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-defense-of-kevin-cash-pulling-blake-snell-in-the-world-series/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;more detailed indicators were worrying&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managerial decisions are first- and second-guessed all the time, but what set this one apart was how emotional the reaction was. (If it had been, say, a controversial bunt call, few would have remembered the next day.) But this wasn’t just a controversial decision, it was upsetting — we feel like starters should get to keep pitching when they have a shutout going, and it’s way more fun when they do. That’s absolutely true! But pretending the evidence says something it doesn’t isn’t helpful to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m absolutely happy to entertain a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; argument that we should expect decision-makers in sports to do the fun thing even when it doesn’t maximize their chances of winning — sports are an entertainment business, after all. But that’s not the discussion that was being had on Tuesday night, and it would require a larger sea change from where we are now.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want starting pitchers to go deeper into games, when the evidence suggests that relievers generally do better, we need to instead change the rules. Maybe this is as simple as forcing teams to have fewer pitchers, thus making the good ones pitch more. Maybe it requires some more out-of-the-box changes (my zany idea is to only allow players who started the game to pitch, which might bring us back 100 years to the era of nine-inning specialists, with the added bonus of seeing more true two-way players). But it’s clear at this point that what’s the most fun is not what gives you the best chance of winning, and MLB should be trying to bring those back into alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[52 things I learned in 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[1.

&lt;li&gt;Former football players die at a significantly higher rate than other pro athletes --- but contrary to the popular narrative, this is 9a) due to heart disease (perhaps a consequence of being overweight) rather than brain disease, and b) football players’ death rates are no higher than men’s in the general population.

&lt;li&gt;I’m suspicious of data that supports the prevailing narrative so thoroughly, but: when the average Boomer was 35 (in 1989), their cohort owned 21% of all US wealth.
