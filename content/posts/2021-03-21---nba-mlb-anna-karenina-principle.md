*"All optimal strategies are alike; each suboptimal strategy is suboptimal in its own way."*

That's a butchering of the famous first line of *Anna Karenina*. But there's [a logic behind it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle): Tolstoy's turn of phrase propounds that there are several necessary characteristics that are required to have a happy family, so all happy families are alike on at least those dimensions; in contrast, unhappy families can be missing any one trait or combination of traits, which means there are many more types of unhappy families. By the same token, for many problems there is only one optimal strategy, and any number of potential sub-optimal strategies.

This is relevant for sports, including the NBA. It is well-known by now that players are taking more three-pointers than ever, and reducing the number of two-point shots they take from more than a few feet away. But [Kirk Goldsberry's shot charts](https://twitter.com/kirkgoldsberry/status/1217109175894831105) show just how extreme the trend has been.

You used to see players and teams specializing in shots all over the court. Basic math shows that many of these areas [were objectively bad to shoot from](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mapping-shots-in-the-nba-changed-it-forever/) -- the success rate on shots from 10-20 feet away was only slightly higher than the success rate on three-pointers, yet three-pointers were worth 50% more. As analytics became more widely adopted, teams optimized their offenses to reduce various inefficiencies. This also reduced the diversity of shot locations, as seen above; each optimal offense is alike.

For each team, optimizing strategy is by definition a good thing: if other teams are suboptimal, you have an advantage; if other teams are also optimizing, you need to keep up. But for the *spectator*, it might make for a worse experience. When all offenses are optimized and alike, there may be less intrigue or surprise about what happens next. It's no coincidence that Tolstoy writes mostly about unhappy families. (Ann Patchett puts it more bluntly: "[Happiness is largely uninteresting](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/18373204-this-is-the-story-of-a-happy-marriage?page=3).")

Now, despite my catchy title above, I don't find this to detract from the NBA watching experience at all. Though players may shoot from the same places, they are still [developing new ways to get there](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/8/5/21353968/nba-three-point-shooting-one-dribble), and I think the style that produces those shots is more exciting than ever: three-pointers, dunks, and crafty passes are great; it's harder to see the nuances of the post-ups and elbow jumpers that dominated earlier eras (and led to a lot of bricks). You may disagree, however.

The sport where this seems to pose a bigger problem is baseball. As [pitchers become better](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/05/21/velocity-is-strangling-baseball-its-grip-keeps-tightening/), making contact becomes harder, leading to a constant increase in strikeouts, walks, and home runs; the latter are fun to watch, but they're dwarfed by the slog of the former two. Pitchers have seemingly realized that [taking more time between pitches allows them to throw harder](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pitchers-are-slowing-down-to-speed-up/), slowing the game down significantly. And teams have realized that an endless parade of relievers is more optimal than letting starting pitchers go deep into games, leading to [understandable but often misguided backlash](https://www.whitakk.com/posts/hot-hand-fallacy-fallacy-fallacy) from fans who find that less fun.

Depending how much these trends hurt fan interest, the rise of analytics might be considered an *[information hazard](https://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf)*: the sport would have been better off not knowing what the optimal strategy was, but now that it's known, it has to be acted upon. But with the increase in available data and analytical capabilities, this was inevitable at some point. (A subject for another time is to think about what other spheres of life we may be seeing this pattern in, such as political discourse.)

What's the solution? Because sports involve an offense and a defense, game theory may seem to help here: for example, in basketball, economics textbooks would dictate that the defense should change its strategy to try to prevent three-pointers and shots at the rim, up until the point where the (marginal) value of taking a shot at any point on the court is equal again. But in practice, there are sometimes constraints: Three is so much greater than two, and so far it seems like there's only so much a defense can do to counteract that. And in baseball, pitchers dictate the action, so if they become more unhittable, there's not much of a counter.

The only tenable solution is likely to be a change in the rules. MLB is now [running a bunch of rules change experiments in the minor leagues](https://www.mlb.com/news/baseball-rule-changes-tested-in-minor-leagues-in-2021); I think most of the specific rules being tested here don't actually do anything to address the underlying issues above, but the overall approach is an admirable one. Teams can't be counted on to do anything against their self-interest in winning games; responsibility for ensuring the product is exciting has to lie with the league, and continual rules changes in some form are probably going to be the only way to do so.
