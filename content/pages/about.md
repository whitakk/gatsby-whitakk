I am a data scientist, writer, and researcher with particular experience in business strategy and sports analytics. 

Most recently I was the analytics manager at the BCG Henderson Institute, where I led a research team of several consultants and data scientists to write perspectives on the future of business strategy. My writing [has been published](/pages/business-strategy/) in Harvard Business Review, Sloan Management Review, Fortune, and the World Economic Forum.

I have extensive experience in [sportswriting](/pages/sports) informed by a quantitative perspective and firsthand statistical analysis. My research paper, "Does a 'coattail effect' influence the valuation of players in the Major League Baseball draft?", was published at the 2013 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, and my writing has appeared in Sports Illustrated and Baseball Prospectus, among other outlets. 

I graduated from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2013. I write on [my personal blog](/page/0) from time to time about random topics inspired by things I read or questions that can be answered with data science. (Any opinions are my own.)
